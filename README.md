## Abyssals | Overconfident | Overreliant on Piloting | Bad Internet | Random Power Outages
### Povertila
Povertila is one of the most friendly, battle tested and used active fit in abyss. Besides being alpha friendly, it also scales very well from alpha to omega, and from tier 3 abyssals to t6 all the way(althought you might wanna try something different at that point.

Base povertila comes with Nosferatu, however, there are very less number of situations where nosferatu can be used and thus multiple other fits can be suggested based on one's preference. All these fits will assume you have max engineering alpha skills.

### For max Povertila skills.

There can be many side effects to standard blue pill, it is therefore requested to roll it prior to entering abyssal deathspace. If there is any side effect that affects your Gila (shield/capacitor capacity penalty etc) jump in and out of your clone and re pop the drug.
